### üöÄ What I'm Building & Exploring

My current toolkit allows me to dive deep into several exciting domains, where I consider myself proficient and always pushing the boundaries:

*   **Web & Mobile Application Development:** My primary playground! I architect and build robust, intuitive, and performant web and cross-platform mobile applications using **React Native** and **React**. From crafting pixel-perfect UIs to designing scalable component architectures, I love bringing ideas to life on the screen.

   
*   **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA):** The backbone of efficient software! I enjoy the intellectual challenge of **DSA** to solve complex problems, optimize solutions, and understand the core mechanics of performance.

   

*   **Cryptography & System-Level Programming with Rust:** Venturing into the intriguing world of secure systems. This is where my curiosity truly sparks ‚Äì understanding secure protocols, low-level optimizations, and leveraging the unparalleled power and memory safety of **Rust** to build robust and reliable cryptographic applications.
