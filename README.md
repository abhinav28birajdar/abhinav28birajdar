## Hi there, fellow explorer! 👋  
### I'm Abhinav Birajdar  

Welcome to my digital workshop and intellectual playground!

I'm a curious and passionate **Full-Stack Web & Android Developer** from Nanded, India — currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science at **VIT Bhopal**. I specialize in building scalable web and mobile experiences, exploring low-level systems with **Rust**, and diving deep into cryptography, blockchain, and real-time applications.

### 🚀 What I'm Building & Exploring

My toolkit blends creativity with system-level thinking across:

- ⚛️ **Full-Stack App Development:**  
  Building robust, scalable, and user-centric apps with **React**, **React Native (Expo)**, **TypeScript**, and **Supabase**. From UI to logic, I love turning ideas into production-ready experiences.

- 🧠 **Data Structures & Algorithms:**  
  DSA is my mental gym — solving problems with optimized solutions using recursion, dynamic programming, backtracking, and graph theory.

- 🔐 **Cryptography & Rust Systems:**  
  Exploring system-level programming with **Rust**, secure protocol design, and memory-safe development. I’m fascinated by how secure, performant systems are built from the ground up.

- 🌐 **Blockchain & DAO Tooling:**  
  Merging governance and transparency with tech — I’m building decentralized civic tools, voting systems, and reputation layers using Web3 concepts.

### 🌱 Currently Leveling Up In

- 🦀 **Advanced Rust:** Async, memory management, and secure architecture.
- 📱 **React Native Optimization:** Native modules, queue systems, and performance tuning.
- 🧑‍💻 **TypeScript Mastery:** Enforcing type safety and scalable project architecture.
- ⛓️ **DAO & Civic Tech Projects:** Using blockchain + Supabase to power real-time public platforms.
